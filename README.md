# OBSAudioMixer
An audio mixer interface for OBS designed for touch screens. Written in UWP and C#. Uses [OBS-Websocket](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket/) for communication. Requires Windows 10 1803 or above to run.

Definitely not "production-ready" - still very much a work in progress! If you would like to contribute please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. If you find any bugs [please check that I'm not currently fixing it already](https://github.com/BradF-99/OBSAudioMixer/projects/1) before submitting an issue.
